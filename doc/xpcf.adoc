= XPCF Cross-Platform Component Framework

XPCF is a lightweight cross platform component framework (it is similar to the well known COM model).
It is released under the Apache 2 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

It is designed to provide dependency injection, with clarity, simplicity and light code base in mind.

It implements the abstractfactory and the factory design patterns (through the ComponentManager and ComponentFactory classes).

== Definitions
=== Reflection
Reflection is a program ability to inspect, and potentially modify its inner high level structures during runtime.

It can be used for observing and modifying program execution at runtime.

This is typically accomplished by dynamically assigning program code at runtime.

Reflective systems use two paradigms : Introspection and intercession.

=== Introspection

Introspection is the ability to inspect a program or a piece of program to figure out the features it provides.

Introspection can be provided to identify the various functionalities a software component provides, a library content or even a component method signature.

NOTE: IHM sample and explanation to add

=== Intercession
Intercession is a program ability to modify its own runtime state or to alter its own interpretation or meaning.

It allows the program to automatically evolve depending on the needs and the context.
NOTE: Define control and data flow

=== Module

A shared library hosting a set of factories to create components/services

=== Component
+ sample

- a class that can have several instances over the application lifetime

- each instance is unloaded (destroyed) when no more reference exists upon one of its interfaces

=== Service

- a component singleton that only has one instance at any given time

- is never unloaded


===  Component/Service interface

A component/service interface in the component framework context is the published part of the component/service functionality.

It represents the contract between the component/service user and the component/service provider.

=== IComponentIntrospect interface

- is a special interface

- does not derive from any other interface

Provides:

- component introspection to query interfaces implemented by the component

- functional reference counting

Special Notes about queryInterface :

- queryInterface from interface A to interface B, must be able to queryInterface back from interface B to interface A

- queryInterface from interface A to the IComponentIntrospect interface, must equal the queryInterface from interface B to the  IComponentIntrospect interface

== Framework functionalities
The XPCF framework provides the following concepts :
- provide features available in other languages (Java/C#) to C/C++
- an "in-code" dependency injection factory to create components and bind them to a specific interface

- a component abstract factory to load components at runtime from modules (named ComponentManager)

- increase modularity with better separation of concerns through interface discovery (using component introspection)

- component dynamic loading resolves implementation scope and naming conflicts : a component with the same type declaration in the same namespace can exist in both modules without conflict : it will be differentiated with its UUID, and its creation will occur in the module scope. (component Full qualified name - namespace and type name - is important inside the module boundary, it is not an issue across module boundary)

- a centralized description of modules, components and interfaces (a mettre plus loin dans implementation et usages : "with a dedicated configuration file")

- module introspection to figure out the components contained and the interfaces they implement

- secure memory management using smart pointers for components  (prevents from memory leaks, dangling null pointer)

- component and service configuration at creation through abstract properties

- support for both components and services

- support for Domain Specific Language through the "IFeatures" interface (for instance, a component can declare "opencv" and "cuda" features as it is an opencv/cuda accelerated implementation of a keypointdetector)

NOTE: Variant properties for configuration are a set of property. Each property is defined as a pair of type, value. Supported types include long, unsigned long, double, string or another subset of properties. Each property has an access definition : in, out or inout.

----

== Making a module (under construction)

The shared library must export the API XPCF_getComponent.

----
long XPCF_getComponent(const boost::uuids::uuid &, SRef<IComponentIntrospect>&)
----

You must return an IComponentIntrospect when called.

== ContractID verses CID (under construction)

CID is a number identifying a specific implementation

ContractID defines a set of functionalities which may contain one or more CIDs

ContractID concept may be implemented through the IFeatures interface

Purpose of Contract IDs

- implementation independence for clients

- functional versioning

== Framework implementation details

=== Module

A shared library hosting a set of factories to create components/services

Provides:

- introspection to figure out which components are available in the module
+ introcession method
- separate implementation from interface : creates the concrete implementation and binds it to the IComponentIntrospect interface

- component creation

- service instanciation

=== Components and Services

An implementation of one or more interfaces identified by a Component UUID

NOTE: The introspection interface is the same for both components and services

==== component
+ sample

- a class that can have several instances over the application lifetime

- each instance is unloaded (destroyed) when no more reference exists upon one of its interfaces

==== service

- a component singleton that only has one instance at any given time

- is never unloaded


===  Component/Service interface
prog par contrat
A component/service interface in the component framework context is :

- based on C++ virtual class

- uniquely identified by an UUID (128-bit number guaranteed to be unique based on timestamps, HW addresses, random seeds)

- mandatory derives from *IComponentIntrospect* (the base interface of all XPCF interfaces)

=== IComponentIntrospect interface

- is a special interface

- does not derive from any other interface

Provides:

- component introspection to query interfaces implemented by the component

- functional reference counting

Special Notes about queryInterface :

- queryInterface from interface A to interface B, must be able to queryInterface back from interface B to interface A

- queryInterface from interface A to the IComponentIntrospect interface, must equal the queryInterface from interface B to the  IComponentIntrospect interface
