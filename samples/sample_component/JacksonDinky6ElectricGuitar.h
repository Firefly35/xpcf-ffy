   * @class JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar
   * This component shows the implementation of a configurable component.
   * It inherits the ConfigurableBase class, hence it provides IConfigurable capabilities.
   * JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar implementation wraps some of its inner members' data as IProperties, giving a generic and public access to those members.
   * JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar configuration is declared in the components' configuration file.
   *
   * @note When a JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar component is created through the XPCF ComponentManager it is also configured with the default values declared in the xpcf_registry_test.xml.
   * @note The needed ComponentTraits<JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar> template struct defining the JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar UUID and description is located
   * in the xpcfSampleComponent_traits.h header file.
   * It allows JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar users to use directly a forward declared type
   * to invoke JacksonDinky6ElectricGuitar creation without depending on the concrete implementation.
