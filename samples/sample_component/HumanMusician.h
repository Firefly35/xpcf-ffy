   * @class HumanMusician
   * This component shows the implementation of a simple component.
   * It inherits the ComponentBase class, hence it does not provide IConfigurable capabilities (no property handling).
   * ComponentBase provides the minimum implementation for interface introspection.
   *
   * @note The needed ComponentTraits<HumanMusician> template struct defining the HumanMusician UUID and description is located
   * in the xpcfSampleComponent_traits.h header file.
   * It allows HumanMusician users to use directly a forward declared type
   * to invoke HumanMusician creation without depending on the concrete implementation.
